# Introduction 
Chatbot with multilingual support for COVID-19 related questions. 

# Getting Started
There are three major pieces.
1.	QnA Maker and Cognitive Service (Managing the Knowledge Base)
2.	Bot App Service (Application based on the Bot Framework)
3.	Cosmos DB (not strictly needed for the Bot, but make it easier to update the Intro Card and save data in the future)

# Build and Test
Use Bot Framework Emulator for local testing.
